== The PointAndZone Library ==

  This library was written to supply ezPoint and ezZone, common primitives for
  M5Display and M5Button, libraries originally written for the M5Stack series
  of devices. They could be useful for many other applications, especially
  anything based on a TFT_eSPI display driver.


== ezPoint and ezZone: Describing Points and Areas on the Screen ==

  The ezPoint and ezZone classes allow you to create variables that hold a point
  or an area on the screen.

  ezPoint(x, y)

    Holds a point on the screen. Has members x and y that hold the coordinates
    of a touch. Values EZ_INVALID for x and y indicate an invalid value,
    and that's what a point starts out with if you declare it without
    parameters. The 'valid()' method tests if a point is valid. If you
    explicitly evaluate a ezPoint as a boolean ("if (p) ..."), you also get
    whether the point is valid, so this is equivalent to writing "if
    (p.valid()) ...".

  ezZone(x, y, w, h)

    Holds a rectangular area on the screen. Members x, y, w and h are for the
    x and y coordinate of the top-left corner and the width and height of the
    rectangle.

  The 'set' method allows you to change the properties of an existing ezPoint
  or ezZone. Using the 'in' or 'contains' method you can test if a point lies
  in a zone.

  The PointAndZone library also provides the low-level support for direction
  from one point to another and for screen rotation translations.


== Looking for Directions? ==

  This library allows you to find the distance in pixels between two ezPoint
  objects with "A.distanceTo(B)". Using "A.directionTo(B)" will output a
  compass course in degrees from A to B. That is, if A lies directly above A
  on the screen the output will be 0, if B lies to the left of A, the output
  will be 270. You can also test whether a direction matches some other
  direction by using "A.isDirectionTo(B, 0, 30)". What this does is take the
  direction from A to B and output 'true' if it is 0, plus or minus 30
  degrees. (So either between 330 and 359 or between 0 and 30).

  Do note that unlike in math, on a display the Y-axis points downwards. So
  pixel coordinates (10, 10) are at direction 135 deg from (0, 0).

  Distance and direction functionality is used in Gesture recognition in the
  M5Button highler level library. Its 'ezEvent' objects have methods that look
  very much like these, except the 'To' in the name is missing because Events
  have a starting and ending point so you can just print
  "myEvent.direction()" or state "if (myEvent.isDirection(0,30) ..."


== Some Examples ==

  ezPoint a;
  ezPoint b(50, 120);
  Serial.println(a.valid());                    // 0
  Serial.println(a);                            // (invalid)
  a.set(10, 30);
  Serial.println(a);                            // (10,30)
  Serial.println(a.valid());                    // 1
  Serial.println(b.y);                          // 120
  Serial.println(a.distanceTo(b));              // 98
  Serial.println(a.directionTo(b));             // 156
  Serial.println(a.isDirectionTo(b, 0, 30));    // 0
  ezZone z(0,0,100, 100);
  Serial.println(z.w);                          // 100
  Serial.println(z.contains(a));                // 1
  Serial.println(b.in(z));                      // 0
