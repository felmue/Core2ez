# This is the website, not the documentation.

* To read the documentation, click [here](https://docs.core2ez.m5ez.com/en/latest/)
* Source files for the documentation are [here](/documentation)
* These are the GitHub Pages files that make [core2ez.m5ez.com](https://core2ez.m5ez.com), which at this moment only redirects to the readable documentation from above. They are only here because GitHub can only serve GitHub Pages sites from `/` or from `/docs` in a repository.
